# Exercise 04 - removeFromArray

Implement a function that takes an array and some other arguments then returns a new array that does not have the other arguements:

```javascript
removeFromArray([1, 2, 3, 4], 3); // should return a new array [1,2,4]
```

## Hints

The first test on this one is fairly easy, but there are a few things to think about(or google) here for the later tests:

- how to remove a single element from an array
- how to deal with multiple optional arguments in a javascript function
- [Check this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments).  Scroll down to the bit about `Array.from` or the spread operator. - [Or this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters).
